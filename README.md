Comparison of Models in Predicting Customer Agreeing to CD at Bank - Portuguese Bank Data UCI Repository

Completed as part of my course work for the Professional Certification in AI & ML through the UC Berkeley Extension.

I compared 5 models, used GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV to optimize them, and experimented with oversampling.  

Best models had 79% F1 scores, 28% recall for false negative predictions, which is a pretty good marker of accuracy given the high variability of the dataset, possibility of not reaching the customer on the phone, and all the other variables contained within the dataset.
